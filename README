Azilian - container implementation written entirely in Perl
=============================================================

I started the Azilian project because most of my management tools for
containers were already written in Perl and constantly interacting 
with LXC trough system, exec and so on was hurting the performance
of our Infrastructure. 

So I decided to implement containers entirely in Perl.

The project should consist of the following tools:

 az-start	- Start a container with predefined configuration
 az-stop	- Stop a named container
 az-restart	- Restart a named container
 az-list	- List all containers(running, stopped or both)
 az-attach	- Enter a container(should be able to execute commands inside
			of the container storage even if the container is not running)
 az-top		- Similar to list, but include stats for CPU, Memory, I/O 
			and Networking
 az-create	- Create a container
 az-destroy - Destroy already existing container

As of now, I have finished only the start, stop and attach commands and 
I'm working on the rest.

Network configuration is not done at the moment.

DEPENDENCIES
